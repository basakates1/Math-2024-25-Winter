    "First, try substituting $x = 0$ directly into the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\sin(3\\cdot 0)}{2\\cdot 0 + 1} = \\frac{\\sin(0)}{1} = \\frac{0}{1} = 0$\n",

    "Since the denominator $2x + 1$ is not zero at $x = 0$ (it equals 1), the limit exists and is equal to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verification Using Limit Properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can use the fact that $\\sin(3x)$ approaches 0 as $x$ approaches 0, and the denominator $2x + 1$ approaches 1. Therefore, the entire fraction approaches:\n",

    "**Using L'H么pital's Rule (if necessary):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not required in this case, L'H么pital's Rule can be applied when both the numerator and denominator approach 0 or both approach infinity. Here, since the numerator approaches 0 and the denominator approaches 1, L'H么pital's Rule is *not* applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for completeness, if we had a similar limit where both numerator and denominator approach 0, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(3x)}{2x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "we *could* apply L'H么pital's Rule by differentiating the numerator and the denominator:\n",

    "The numerator, $\\sin(x)$, oscillates between -1 and 1. The denominator, $x^2 + 1$, grows without bound as $x$ approaches $\\pm\\infty$.\n",

    "Thus, as $x$ becomes very large (positively or negatively), the denominator dominates, and the value of $g(x)$ approaches zero.\n",
